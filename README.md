# Actuators
> This repository contains 3 tasks. Task 1 uses two push buttons to control the rotation of a servo motor. When push button 1 is pressed the servo turns 45 degrees CW. When push button 2 is pressed, the servo turns 45 degrees CCW. 
> Task 2 uses a stepper motor. The internal shaft of the stepper motor has 32 steps per revolution and the output has a gear reduction of 64; resulting in 2048 steps per revolution. Task 2 relies on 2 push buttons. Push button 1 rotates the stepper motor CW and push button 2 rotates the stepper CCW. Task 3 uses a joystick to control the rotation of the stepper motor and servo motor. When the joystick moves to the right/left the stepper turns CW and CCW. When the joystick moves forward/backward, the stepper turns CW and CCW.
